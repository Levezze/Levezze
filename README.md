## What I Do

I architect and ship full-stack applications from concept to production, specializing in **AI-powered platforms** and **scalable web systems**. My background in architecture gives me a unique lens for systems thinking—I approach software the way I once designed buildings: with attention to structure, flow, and how humans actually use what I build.

Currently building an AI platform at a stealth startup that transforms dense content into engaging, narrated experiences. Previously co-founded **CTies**, a generative AI urban planning platform that modeled millions of 3D design iterations while processing planning decisions for 100,000+ future residents.

## Featured Work

### 🚀 [AI Content Platform](https://levezze.com) (Stealth Startup)
Building a platform that solves information overload by transforming structured content into narrated, developer-facing outputs. Full ownership of technical architecture from backend AI workflows to real-time frontend editing.

**Stack:** Next.js · FastAPI · OpenAI SDK · LangChain · PostgreSQL · Redis · Cloudflare R2 & Queues

---

### 🏙️ [C-Ties](https://www.cties.net) - Generative AI Urban Planning
Co-founded and built an AI platform that revolutionized urban planning by modeling millions of 3D design iterations with real-time KPI analysis. Replaced fragmented workflows with unified logic evaluating density, climate impact, and regulatory compliance simultaneously.

**Impact:** Reduced design iteration time by 40% for projects housing 100,000+ residents  
**Stack:** React · Flask · Python · PostgreSQL · Grasshopper · RhinoCompute · Mapbox · Pandas

### 🎨 [Interactive 3D Portfolio](https://github.com/Levezze/portfolio-frontend)
Personal portfolio featuring a Three.js cube interface where an AI agent (Gimli-AI) navigates by rotating between faces. Each "page" is dynamically rendered on the 3D cube in real-time—no routes, just pure spatial navigation.

**Challenge:** Synchronizing 3D world units with CSS pixels across responsive breakpoints  
**Stack:** Next.js · Three.js · FastAPI · WebSocket · Jotai · Tailwind CSS
