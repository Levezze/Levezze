### Full-Stack & AI Engineer | Systems Architect

üìç Brooklyn, NY | üîó [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lev-zhitnik/) | üìß contact@levezze.com

I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in building production-grade applications and AI-driven systems. My background in architecture and urban design gives me a unique perspective on systems thinking, allowing me to translate complex requirements into clean, scalable, and human-centered software. I thrive on building things that solve real problems, from initial prototype to robust, end-to-end platforms.

I'm currently seeking a full-stack engineering role where I can contribute to a collaborative team, tackle challenging technical problems, and continue to grow as an engineer.
